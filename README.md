Hi!

Things I learned:
 - components and props
 - Styling with CSS
    - custom theming bootstrap components
 - mapping over data when dynamically generating components
- regex for importing image files

Biggest Challenges:
 - Creating an image modal that looked and behaved the way I wanted it to
 - Making the layout responsive in a way that looked nice
